        About Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary
      </h1>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4 italic mx-auto">
        Did you know that Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects North
        America’s only living coral barrier reef? From beautiful reefs and lush
        kelp forests to deep-sea canyons and mysterious underwater shipwrecks,
        national marine sanctuaries located around the country protect some of
        our nation’s most unique riches.
      </p>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4 italic mx-auto">
        In this section, you will learn about the National Marine Sanctuary
        System, the history of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and about
        the areas and resources that the sanctuary protect.

        First established in 1972, the National Marine Sanctuary System has
        grown to include 13 national marine sanctuaries and Papahānaumokuākea
        and Rose Atoll marine national monuments. Managed by the National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (or “NOAA”), the mission of these
        marine protected areas cover more than 600,000 square miles of marine
        and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Gulf of Mexico, and
        from Lake Huron to American Samoa. Ranging in size from less than one
        square mile to 582,000 square miles, each sanctuary site is a special
        place, managed to conserve, protect, and enhance biodiversity,
        ecological integrity and cultural legacy.

      <h2 class="pt-4">A Sanctuary in the Florida Keys</h2>
      <p class="pt-4">
        Warning signs of the fragility and finite nature of marine resources in
        the Florida Keys have been present for years. Concerns over pollution,
        overfishing, overuse, and misuse, and the subsequent demise of the
        area’s coral reefs, eventually led to the establishment of the Key Largo
        and Looe Key National Marine Sanctuaries.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-4">
        While these sanctuaries and other marine protected areas, such as John
        Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, were steps in the right direction to
        protect reefs, things in the Keys continued to decline. In 1990, amidst
        concerns about deteriorating water quality, the threat of oil drilling,
        and numerous vessel groundings, Congress designated the Florida Keys
        National Marine Sanctuary, incorporating the preexisting Key Largo and
        Looe Key sanctuaries.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-4">
        Today, the sanctuary protects 2,900 square nautical miles of waters
        surrounding the Florida Keys, from south of Miami and extending westward
        to encompass the Dry Tortugas, but excluding the Dry Tortugas National
        Park. The shoreward boundary of the sanctuary is the mean high-water
        mark, meaning that once you set foot in Keys waters, you have entered
        the sanctuary.

        />
      </div>

      <p class="pt-4">
        Within the boundaries of the sanctuary lie spectacular, unique, and
        nationally significant marine environments. The sanctuary protects the
        world’s third largest barrier reef, which is composed of more than 6,000
        individual reefs. More than 2,000 square nautical miles of seagrass
        meadows blanket the seafloor of South Florida. Approximately 1,700
        mangrove-fringed islands stretch for over 1,800 miles of shoreline
        within the sanctuary. More than 6,000 species of marine life – including
        more than 500 species of fish and 50 species of coral – call these
        habitats home. The sanctuary also protects pieces of our nation’s
        history such as shipwrecks and other archeological treasures.
