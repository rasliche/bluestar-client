      <p class="pt-4 italic">
        Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary visitors are invited to dive,
        swim, snorkel, or fish; however, rules and regulations are in place to
        make sure that these activities only happen in ways – and at places –
        that are not harmful to sanctuary resources.
      </p>

      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary uses a strategy called “marine
        zoning” to protect special habitat types such as corals, to avoid
        conflict by user groups such as divers and anglers, and to balance
        commercial and recreational interests with the need for a sustainable
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        Some rules within the sanctuary apply throughout its waters while others
        apply only to specific zones. In this section, you will learn about
        sanctuary-wide regulations, zone-specific regulations, other
        regulations, and sanctuary mooring buoys.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w-5/6 pt-4">Sanctuary-wide Regulations</h2>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        To protect resources within the sanctuary, there are several regulations
        that apply for the sanctuary as a whole.

        Within the boundaries of the sanctuary lie spectacular, unique, and
        nationally significant marine environments. The sanctuary protects the
        world’s third largest barrier reef, which is composed of more than 6,000
        individual reefs. More than 2,000 square nautical miles of seagrass
        meadows blanket the seafloor of South Florida. Approximately 1,700
        mangrove-fringed islands stretch for over 1,800 miles of shoreline
        within the sanctuary. More than 6,000 species of marine life – including
        more than 500 species of fish and 50 species of coral – call these
        habitats home. The sanctuary also protects pieces of our nation’s
        history such as shipwrecks and other archeological treasures.
