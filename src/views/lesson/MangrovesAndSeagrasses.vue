      Mangroves and Seagrasses
    </h1>
    <p class="lg:w-5/6 pt-4 italic">
      With so many colorful corals and diverse fish in the Florida Keys National
      Marine Sanctuary, it’s easy to overlook the plants that make sea life
      possible. Seagrasses and mangroves play a crucial role in the Florida Keys
      ecosystem and economy. Like many other ocean resources, mangroves and
      seagrasses also face challenges that are threatening their health and
      existence here in the Florida Keys.
    </p>
    <p class="lg:w-5/6 pt-4 italic">
      This module will discuss seagrasses and mangroves, their roles in
      supporting the ecosystem and economy of south Florida, and how you can
      help protect them.

      First established in 1972, the National Marine Sanctuary System has grown
      to include 13 sanctuaries and one national monument. Managed by the
      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (or “NOAA”), the mission
      of these marine protected areas cover more than 150,000 square miles of
      marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Gulf of Mexico,
      Lake Huron, and American Samoa. Ranging in size from less than one square
      mile to 137,792 square miles, each sanctuary site is a special place,
      managed to conserve, protect, and enhance biodiversity, ecological
      integrity and cultural legacy.

      <h2 class="w-5/6 pt-4">A Sanctuary in the Florida Keys</h2>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        Warning signs of the fragility and finite nature of marine resources in
        the Florida Keys have been present for years. Concerns over pollution,
        overfishing, overuse, and misuse, and the subsequent demise of the
        area’s coral reefs, eventually led to the establishment of the Key Largo
        and Looe Key National Marine Sanctuaries.
      </p>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        While these sanctuaries and other marine protected areas, such as John
        Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, were steps in the right direction to
        protect reefs, things in the Keys continued to decline. In 1990, amidst
        concerns about deteriorating water quality, the threat of oil drilling,
        and numerous vessel groundings, Congress designated the Florida Keys
        National Marine Sanctuary, incorporating the preexisting Key Largo and
        Looe Key sanctuaries.
      </p>
      <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
        Today, the sanctuary protects 2,900 square nautical miles of waters
        surrounding the Florida Keys, from south of Miami and extending westward
        to encompass the Dry Tortugas, but excluding the Dry Tortugas National
        Park. The shoreward boundary of the sanctuary is the mean high-water
        mark, meaning that once you set foot in Keys waters, you have entered
        the sanctuary.

    <p class="w-5/6 pt-4">
      Within the boundaries of the sanctuary lie spectacular, unique, and
      nationally significant marine environments. The sanctuary protects the
      world’s third largest barrier reef, which is composed of more than 6,000
      individual reefs. More than 2,000 square nautical miles of seagrass
      meadows blanket the seafloor of South Florida. Approximately 1,700
      mangrove-fringed islands stretch for over 1,800 miles of shoreline within
      the sanctuary. More than 6,000 species of marine life – including more
      than 500 species of fish and 50 species of coral – call these habitats
      home. The sanctuary also protects pieces of our nation’s history such as
      shipwrecks and other archeological treasures.
